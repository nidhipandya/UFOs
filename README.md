# UFO

### Overview of Project:
The purpose of this project is to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. Using this application a user can add table filters for the date, city, state, country, and shape.

## Results
There arent any buttons to get the filtered results. The user needs to just enter the filter values they want to use into the input boxes.  The webpage refreshes automatically after each input to provide instant results.

### Summary
Some changes that would make the webpage better would be an export button or function that could export the displayed data to a CSV or Excel file that the user could then save to their computer.  

There are certain fields in the database that the web page doesn't look at during the filtering.  This is due to the inconsistency of the data in these fields.  If future iterations of this database could standardize data fields and adhere strictly to the type of data within each field, the webpage could provide more detailed filtering of data. 

###Recommendations for Further Development
The Filtered data should be able to be stored to a local computer.  
The filtered results should also be able to produce a graphical output for easier analysis.
